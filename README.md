# Fast-React-Pizza

Welcome to fast-react-pizza a project I learned through the course I was taking that implements many of the modern react technologies that are up to date.

## React-router

Here react router was used for data writing and fetching to the API provided by the course

## Redux-toolkit

Redux toolkit was used as a global state management system for this SPA.

## Tailwind

Here tailwind was used to style this beautiful app, and tailwind is one of my favourite libraries to date!
